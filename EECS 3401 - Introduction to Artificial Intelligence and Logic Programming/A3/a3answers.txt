%% 6. Which of the four heuristics are admissible?

%%  - hfn_null
<6.1>
no

%%  - hfn_misplaced
<6.2>
yes

%%  - hfn_manhattan
<6.3>
yes

%%  - hfn_inversions
<6.4>
yes




%% /* ------------------------------------------------------ */

% 7. Suppose for sliding a tile to the left we would change the
% cost from 1 to 0.5 and leave all the other moves the same cost.
% Does this affect the admissibility of the heuristics? Which of
% them are admissible now?


%%  - hfn_null
<7.1.1>
yes

<7.1.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less] 


%%  - hfn_misplaced
<7.2.1>
yes

<7.2.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]


%%  - hfn_manhattan
<7.3.1>
yes

<7.3.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]


%%  - hfn_inversions
<7.4.1>
yes

<7.4.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]



%% /* ------------------------------------------------------ */

% 8. Now suppose we would change the cost for sliding a tile to the
% left to 2 and leave all the other moves the same cost. Does this
% now affect the admissibility of the four heuristics? Again, which
% of them are admissible?

%%  - hfn_null
<8.1.1>
no

<8.1.2>
This increases the the amount of expanded states and causes it to search for every possible state so it still is not admissible


%%  - hfn_misplaced
<8.2.1>
yes

<8.2.2>
This increases the the amount of expanded states so it still is not admissible


%%  - hfn_manhattan
<8.3.1>
yes

<8.3.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]


%%  - hfn_inversions
<8.4.1>
no

<8.4.2>
This causes it to search for other paths due to not being able to move left and forces it to expand a large amount of states to achieve the goal.



%% /* ------------------------------------------------------ */

% 9. In the former modification (sliding to the LEFT costs 0.5), can
% you say for sure which heuristic will be the fastest (expand the
% least number of states) in finding a (not necessary optimal)
% solution? Explain.
<9.1>
yes

<9.2>
It was shown that when the cost was reduced, hfn_manhattan expanded less states than when the cost was at 1 and 2, while hfm_misplaced expanded 
a few more states. hfn_null always expanded a large amount of states.

% 10. One can obtain another heuristic for the N-puzzle by relaxing the
% problem as follows: let's say that a tile can move from square A to
% square B if B is blank.  The exact solution to this problem defines
% Gaschnig's heuristic. Explain why Gaschnig's heuristic is at
% least as accurate as hfn_misplaced.  Show some cases where it
% is more accurate than both the hfn_misplaced} and 
% hfn_manhattan} heuristics.  Can you suggest a way to calculate
% Gaschnig's heuristic efficiently?

<10.1>
It is as accurate hfn_misplaced because it has the same conditions as it by only checking the tiles next to the blank.

<10.2>
Gaschnig's heuristic would be more accurate if it relax some conditions by
allowing movement to any space, regardless whether they have a tile or blank.
This would allow a solution by moving the tiles directly to its proper positions.

<10.3>
One way to calculate Gaschnig's heuristic is to count the amount of moves it takes to reach the goal.
